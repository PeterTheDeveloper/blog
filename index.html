            <p class="header">What is a function ?</p>
        <p class="text">Function are basically the assembly line of the programming world.
        With this one concept, it empowers us to automate any process we can think of. 
        By adding code to a function you can complete multiple tasks by simply invoking the function
        same. The function will then run everything within the block of code. 
        Rather than type that same code multiple times for whenever you need it, 
        functions allow us to run code any number of times, greatly increasing one's efficiency. 
        Simply, create it once and you know it'll run the same code everytime.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <p>We use functions all the time. For this demonstration we will be coding in JavaScript. JS is a language that holds many built in
        functions like join(), replace(), .random(), and so on. They can all be used in different ways. <br><br> But what if you had to do more complex tasks like manipulating strings or arrays and objects ?</p>
        <br>
        <p> Examples of Built-in functions</p>
        <pre>
            <!--Flex each code snippet instead of using break tags-->
            <code class="example-code"> return Math.random();  // Outputs a random number between and 1.
                <br><br> return Math.floor(10.5); // Outputs 11, rounds down from the number placed <br>                              //  within the parameters.
                <br><br> return Math.sqrt(16); // Ouputs 4</code>
        </pre>
<br>
        <p class="header">Creating your own function</p>
        <p>You've probably seen something similar to this.</p>
        <pre class="example-code">
            <code>function ourNewFunction() { some code to do a task };</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Though, there are many ways to do this.</p>
        <pre class="example-code">
            <code> function ourNewFunction(parameters) = {some code to do a task with <b>function declaration.</b>}
                <br><br> let ourNewFunction = function(parameters) {some code to do a task with <b>Function expressions</b>.}<br>
                <br> ourNewFunction = (parameters) => {some code to do a task with <b>Arrow functions</b>.}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>To really understand this concept you must be familiar with function parameters and arguments.<br>A <b>Parameter</b> are names or placeholders created in the function definition. They can be named whatever you want, but <b>should</b> be named appropriately for what your function does. For example, if your function will take a number or an array of number an appropriate name for your parameter might be int or arr.
        Each parameter is separated by a comma.</p>
        <p>Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is called upon. <br> If your function takes a 2 strings, you would have 2 strings as arguments when invoking the function.</p>
        
        <pre class="example-code">
            <code> let addStringsFunction = (str1, str2) {return str1 + str2}<br><br> addStringsFunction("Hi my name is", "Mr.Developer"); // Ouputs "Hi my name is Mr.Developer"</code>
        </pre>
        
        <p class="header">A function's scope</p>
        <p>When you create a function, the variables and other things defined inside the function are inside their own separate scope, 
        meaning that they are locked away in their own separate compartments, unreachable from code outside the functions.</p>
        <p><b>Local Scope</b><br>
        Variables declared inside the functions become Local to the function and are considered in the corresponding local scope. This means they can only be referenced locally.
        <br>
        <p><b>Block Scope</b><br>
        A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.
        <p><b>Global Scope</b><br>
        There's only one Global scope in the JavaScript document. The area outside all the functions is consider the global scope and the variables defined inside the global scope can be accessed and altered in any other scopes.
        
        <p><b>Function Scope</b><br>
        Whenever you declare a variable in a function, the variable is visible only within the function. You can't access it outside the function. var is the keyword to define variable for a function-scope accessibility.
        </p>
       
        <p>Knowing about the different kinds of scope is important in conjunction with hoisting. 
        Hoisting is the native behavior of JavaScript that essentially hoists or 'lifts' all declared variables to the top of their scope. 
        This allows us to avoid reference errors within our code. <br> It is also important to know that <b>Function definitions are hoisted â€” expressions are not</b>.</p>

        <pre class="example-code">
            <code>let name = 'Chris';<br>let function sayMyName(name) {<br>alert('Hello ' + name );}</code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>This code will give reference error because expressions are not hoisted.</p>
        <pre class="example-code">
            <code>let name = 'Chris';<br>function sayMyName() {<br>alert('Hello ' + name );}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This code will run because function decalrations are within scope due to hositing.</p>
